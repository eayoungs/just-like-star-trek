# Status

We have PoE powered IoT light fixtures, a switch to connect and power them and then some pieces of software.
Most of the software is working and really ugly. The programmers will want to keep it internal so to see it
you'll have to join and start help with us fix the uglyness. We can control DALi lights via 
Helvar DALi Router using HelvarNet protocol on a library that Ivan did just this saturday.
